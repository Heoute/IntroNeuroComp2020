    "There are several distributions of Python around, and once you have Python installed, there is generally a way of installing additional packages for that installation of Python. Probably, there is already a \"system\" Python installed with your OS (Mac, Unix, Windows...), as Python is used as a programming language throughout. However, I would strongly recommanded to install a seperate version of Python for your own programming and scientific use, which you can freely configure, screw up, and reinstall as much as you wish. A pretty complete, widely used Python distribution which comes with many pre-installed packages and should work out-of-the-box (but still allows for much flexibility if you wish), is the Anaconda distribution, which you can find here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual (you should go for the Python 3.x version). It should be relatively straightforward to install and to use, but in case you'd like to have a look before, here is the documentation: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is basically a browser-based interface to Python, where one can easily combine Python code with written text (like this paragraph here). It allows to organize one's code in practical chunks or \"cells\" of code, which can be executed one at a time. If you have installed the Anaconda distribution, jupyter notebook should be directly available from the Anaconda Navigator (which you can start via the launcher in Windows, or from the Applications folder in macOS), or you can start it from command line with the command ``jupyter notebook``. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have your own Python version that you want to use with the jupyter notebook, you can install jupyter using ``pip install jupyter``, after which you should be able to start it with ``jupyter notebook`` from the command line.\n",
